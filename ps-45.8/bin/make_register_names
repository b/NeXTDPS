# Regenerates the file registernames.ps.
# $(PACKAGE_LIST) is a "make" macro defined as part of the product build
# procedure; it expands into a list of package library pathnames of
# the form:
#   /usr/ps/packages/language/v012/v001/mc68020sun/DEVELOP/language.a
# This script looks in the sources directory for each such package,
# looking for a file named <package>names.ps (e.g., languagenames.ps).
# When it finds one, it appends a command of the form:
#   (/usr/ps/packages/language/v012/v001/sources/languagenames.ps) run
# to the standard output file.
