% Implementation of findfont in products with no file system.
% Performs font substitution only if SubstituteFont is present in $error;
% calls that procedure with font name on stack to obtain substitute
% font name. Raises invalidfont if SubstituteFont is not present or if
% the substituted font does not exist.
