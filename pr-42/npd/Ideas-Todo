Hey Emacs, these comments are -*-Text-*-

Status callback should have a way to report informational errors as
well as fatal errors.  Perhaps the PrintPanel should have a "Quiet"
preference that discards informational errors.

In printing the document, the basic loop should scan ahead for
conforming comments, print the PostScript up to the comment, and then
do a PPD substitution for the comment.

Make sure to write a test program that spits bad PostScript at the new
npd.

Get a whole bunch of PostScript files to use in a test suite.  Perhaps
Adobe has some.

Move strings into MachO segment.

Having the window server go away should not make npd pause.
