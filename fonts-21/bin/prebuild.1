.SH NAME
prebuild \- Build PostScript prebuilt font file from bitmap description files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /usr/bin/prebuild
.B fontname
.B fonttype
.B fontuniqueid
.B fontcharactersetname
.B bdffile ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I prebuild
is used to build a binary file format known as the prebuilt
file for use by the NextStep(tm) Window Server.
It takes as input a number of standard
Adobe Bitmap Description format files and
produces a much more compact binary representation
of the bits in those files.  The Bitmap Distribution
Format files provided as input to
.B prebuild
must be given in order from smallest to largest.
.PP
In Display PostScript, every face of every font is defined
by a PostScript program (see the PostScript(R) Language
Reference Manual for more details on how to create a 
PostScript font).  In order for the NextStep system to
use a font, the font creator must provide the PostScript
language file defining the outlines of the characters
of the font, and an Adobe Font Metrics file describing
separately the widths of those characters.
.PP
To allow the window server to see this new font, the outline
and afm files for it must be placed in the appropriate
subdirectories one of the three
standard Fonts directories:
.I /NextLibrary/Fonts,
.I /LocalLibrary/Fonts,
or
.I ~/Library/Fonts.
Below each of these three directories there are three
subdirectories, named, respectively:
.I outline,
to contain the PostScript-language outline fonts definitions;
.I afm,
to contain the afm files; and
.I bitmap,
to contain the files output by
.B prebuild.
.PP
.B prebuild
outputs a file in the current directory whose name is the name
of the font followed by the suffix indicating the byte sex of
the file (
.I .bepf
for big-endian files, and
.I .lepf
for little-endian file).  This file should be placed in the
.I bitmap
subdirectory of the appropriate 
.I Fonts
directory.  By convention, the BDF files used as input to
.B prebuild
may be kept in a fourth subdirectory of
.I Fonts,
called
.I bitmapSources,
however this is not required by 
.B prebuild.

.SH BUGS
.B prebuild
should output both a .bepf and a .lepf file.  This will 
be fixed.  
The fonttype and fontuniqueid are actually ignored.
